In order to use the modelling pipeline, you will need to run the preprocessor on the training data - the variable called `X_train` in the modelling cells above. The preprocessor actually has two methods - `fit_transform`, which adapts the preprocessor to a dataset and then applies the preprocessing functions, and `transform`, which uses an adapted preprocessor and applies it to a new dataset. This is important because we should only `fit` to our training data, and use `transform` on test data, because this gives us a realistic measure of model performance.\n",
